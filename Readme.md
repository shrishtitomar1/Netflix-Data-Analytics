# Netflix Data Analysis Project

#### Objective
This project applies Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset.
Netflix uses data analytics to:<br>
Provide users with personalized recommendations<br>
Predict the popularity of original content before production decisions

#### Tasks Performed
1. Removing the duplicate records from the dataset
2. Checking if there is any null value present in the column

#### Business Questions Solved

Q1. For Blood and Water, what is the show id and who is the director?<br>
Q2. In which year was the highest number of TV shows released? (with bar graph)<br>
Q3. How many Movies and TV Shows are in the dataset? (with bar graph)<br>
Q4. Show all the movies released in 2020<br>
Q5. Show only the Title of all TV shows released in India<br>
Q6. Show Top 10 Directors with the highest number of shows/movies on Netflix<br>
Q7. How many TV shows got the TV-14 rating after 2018?<br>
Q8. What is the maximum duration of a Movie/TV Show on Netflix?<br>
Q9. Which country has the highest number of TV shows?<br>
Q10. How can we sort the dataset by year?<br>
Q11. Find all instances where:
Category = Movie and Genre = Dramas
Category = TV Show and Genre = Kids TV

#### Visualizations
Heatmap – Check missing/null values
Heatmap (Top 10 Years) – Titles count by year & type
Scatterplot – Movie duration vs release year
Bar Graph – Titles released per year
Histogram – Movie durations distribution
Countplot – Count of Movies vs TV Shows
Line Plot – Trend of titles released over years
Bar Graph – Top 10 countries with the most content

#### Libraries Used
NumPy → numerical operations
Pandas → data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib → visualization
Seaborn → advanced visualizations

#### Insights

Netflix has seen rapid growth in content after 2015.
The majority of content falls under Movies, but TV Shows are rising steadily.
The USA and India are top contributors of Netflix titles.
Most Movies are within 90–120 minutes duration.
The TV-14 rating is dominant among TV shows, especially after 2018.
