# Netflix Data Analysis Project

#### Objective
This project applies Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset.
Netflix uses data analytics to:<br>
Provide users with personalized recommendations<br>
Predict the popularity of original content before production decisions

#### Tasks Performed
1. Removing the duplicate records from the dataset
2. Checking if there is any null value present in the column

#### Business Questions Solved

Q1. For Blood and Water, what is the show id and who is the director?<br>
Q2. In which year was the highest number of TV shows released? (with bar graph)<br>
Q3. How many Movies and TV Shows are in the dataset? (with bar graph)<br>
Q4. Show all the movies released in 2020<br>
Q5. Show only the Title of all TV shows released in India<br>
Q6. Show Top 10 Directors with the highest number of shows/movies on Netflix<br>
Q7. How many TV shows got the TV-14 rating after 2018?<br>
Q8. Show Content Added Over Time.<br>
Q9. Find Top 10 Countries with Most Titles.<br>
Q10. How can we sort the dataset by Year?<br>
Q11. Find all the instances where:
type is 'Movie' and listed_in is 'Dramas' or type is 'TV Show' and listed_in is 'Children'

#### Visualizations
Heatmap – Check missing/null values<br>
Heatmap (Top 10 Years) – Titles count by year & type<br>
Scatterplot – Movie duration vs release year<br>
Bar Graph – Titles released per year<br>
Histogram – Movie durations distribution<br>
Countplot – Count of Movies vs TV Shows<br>
Line Plot – Trend of titles released over years<br>
Bar Graph – Top 10 countries with the most content

#### Libraries Used
NumPy → numerical operations<br>
Pandas → data cleaning & manipulation<br>
Matplotlib → visualization<br>
Seaborn → advanced visualizations

#### Insights

Netflix has seen rapid growth in content after 2015.<br>
The majority of content falls under Movies, but TV Shows are rising steadily.<br>
The USA and India are top contributors of Netflix titles.<br>
Most Movies are within 90–120 minutes duration.<br>
